These are my notes about the steps to make a new release of
Gnuplot.py.

1. Edit the following files for the release:

   NEWS.txt -- add the version number at the top of the file and make
       sure that the comments are up-to-date.

   ANNOUNCE.txt -- add the version number at the top of the file and
       update the blurbs as appropriate.

   Gnuplot.html -- update the version number where it appears.  Update
       the "News" section.

   __init__.py -- increment the __version__ string.

2. Check the changes into CVS.

3. Create new documentation using happydoc:

   $ rm -rf doc
   $ ( cd .. ; 
       happydoc -d Gnuplot/doc -t 'Gnuplot.py' \
         --author='Michael Haggerty <mhagger@alum.mit.edu>' Gnuplot )

4. Generate the source distributions:

   $ python2 ./setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip

5. Generate the binary distributions.  [I don't think a binary
   distribution is worthwhile because the place that the files need to
   be installed is dependent on the version of python being used.]

   $ python2 ./setup.py bdist --format=gztar,zip,rpm,wininst
